    "title": "VS Code Setup",
    "section": "Creating Virtual Environments for Each Project",
    "text": "Creating Virtual Environments for Each Project\nPython virtual environments allow developers to manage various libraries and Python versions needed for different projects independently. This enables multiple projects with different dependency requirements to operate on the same system without conflicts, isolates the development environment to prevent issues in one project from affecting others, and supports easy replication or deployment of specific project settings to different environments. Virtual environments help maintain consistency between development, testing, and production environments and enable team members to work in the same settings. For these reasons, virtual environments are essential tools that significantly enhance project stability and development efficiency. The following explains how to implement Python virtual environments in VS Code.\n\nCreating Project Folders\nCreate project folders as described earlier. However, there is no option to create folders directly in VS Code. Therefore, it is recommended to use Windows Explorer to create project folders. (Alternatively, you can use the terminal tab in the title & menu bar of VS Code to create project folders, but this method may be more cumbersome than using Windows Explorer.) For example, name and create project folders as follows (e.g., C:-x.y.z-Project_Name).\n\n\nOpening Project Folders\nOpen project folders using the Explorer menu (Ⓐ Activity bar) or the File menu in the title & menu bar. (This is to ensure that the project folder opens when you open the terminal later.)\n\n\nCreating a New Terminal\nSelect the New Terminal option in the Terminal menu under the title & menu bar to open a new terminal in the Ⓓ panel. If the opened terminal is PowerShell, select the v(Select Default Profile) menu next to the +(New Terminal) icon on the right side of the panel title bar (Figure 4). Then, choose Command Prompt to create a new Command Prompt terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Command Prompt Terminal Creating\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Python Virtual Environment\nEnter and execute the following command in the newly created terminal.\n\n\n\nCommand Prompt Terminal\n\npython -m venv venv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeaning of python -m venv venv\n\n\n\n\n\nThe command uses the built-in Python module venv to create a new virtual environment.\n1. python This part calls the Python interpreter installed on the system. It uses the Python version set as default on the system to execute the module specified next.\n2. The -m flag instructs Python to run the module directly from the command line. It finds the Python module corresponding to the module name (venv, etc.) following this flag and executes that module like a script.\n3. The first venv is the name of the built-in Python module for creating virtual environments. This module is used to create, manage, and maintain virtual environments, providing an independent Python execution environment. This environment contains an independent Python interpreter, libraries, and scripts.\n4. The second venv is the directory name of the virtual environment to be created. In this example, a folder named ‘venv’ is created within the current directory, and the virtual environment is set up inside it. The directory name can be specified as any name the user desires, and the virtual environment is configured within the folder created with this name.\nTherefore, the command python -m venv venv creates a folder named ‘venv’ in the current working directory and sets up a new independent Python virtual environment inside it. This virtual environment provides a separate environment to install and manage Python packages independently from other projects. It prevents dependency conflicts and effectively manages libraries with different requirements for each project.\n\n\n\nThe successful execution of the above command will create a venv virtual environment folder under the project folder. If you see a folder named venv under the project folder in the Explorer, the operation was successful (Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Validation of venv Folder Creation\n\n\n\nThe following folders and files are created under the venv folder generated by the virtual environment (Figure 6).\n\n\n\n(venv)/\n   ├── Include/                  # Folder for C/C++ header files\n   ├── Lib/                      # Folder for standard libraries and third-party packages\n   │      └── site-packages/     # Folder where packages installed via pip are located\n   ├── Scripts/                  # Folder containing executable scripts, such as pip\n   │      ├── activate           # Script to activate the virtual environment\n   │      ├── deactivate         # Script to deactivate the virtual environment\n   │      ├── python.exe         # Python executable for the virtual environment\n   │      └── pip.exe            # pip executable for managing packages in the virtual environment\n   └── pyvenv.cfg                # Configuration file for the virtual environment\n\n\n\nFigure 6: (venv) Directory Structure\n\n\n\nWhen you install packages using pip in the virtual environment, they are installed in the site-packages folder within the venv virtual folder, rather than globally. This allows you to manage the packages needed for each project independently, preventing dependency conflicts between projects.\n\n\nLinking Project and Virtual Environment\nSelect View from the title menu and choose Command Palette. Then select Python: Select Interpreter from the list of available commands (Figure 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Select Interpreter in Command Palette\n\n\n\nUpon selection, all available Python interpreters will be displayed. Choose the python.exe file located in the Scripts folder under the venv virtual environment folder created in the project folder (Figure 8).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Interpreter Selection\n\n\n\n\n\nValidating the Virtual Environment\nEven after linking the Python interpreter of the virtual environment to a specific project, there will be no visible changes on the screen. To confirm that the connection was successful, open a new terminal. If you see the virtual environment folder (venv) enclosed in parentheses in the terminal prompt, as shown in Figure 9, it indicates a successful connection. This confirms that the virtual environment is currently active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Validation of Virtual Environment Activation",

As of September 27, 2024, the latest 64-bit Windows installation file is R-4.4.1-win.exe.\n\nInstallation Path\nBy default, R is installed in C:\\\\Program Files\\\\R\\\\R-4.4.1 on Windows. However, the following path is recommended by the study group.\n\n\n\nR Install Option Window\n\nC:\\R\\R-4.4.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros and Cons of C:\\Program Files\\ and C:\\ Paths\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Windows applications are installed in the Program Files folder, making it a standard location for managing system software and applications, which facilitates system organization. The Program Files folder requires special system permissions, making it difficult for regular users to easily modify files within the folder, thus protecting against changes by malicious software. However, it can be inconvenient for users who want to use R freely as administrative privileges are required for installing or updating R packages, and the Program Files path contains spaces, which may cause issues with older scripts or tools that do not handle spaces in paths correctly.\nDirect installation under C:\\ (e.g., C:\\R): Installing or updating packages does not require administrative privileges, and since there are no spaces in the path, this path can be used in all scripts or programs without compatibility issues. However, programs installed with user permissions may be relatively less secure, more susceptible to changes by malicious software, and if non-standard installation locations are used, system software and applications may be distributed, making management difficult.\nIn conclusion, when choosing an installation location, factors such as security, user convenience, and ease of system management should be considered. A custom path like C:\\R may be more convenient for individual users or development environments, while installing under C:\\Program Files may be more suitable for corporate environments or situations where security is a priority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment Variable Configuration\nAfter installation, you need to specify the R executable file path in the system environment variables.\n\nWhen calling R from users or programs like RStudio, or when installing packages, the system needs to know the installation path of the R executable file to proceed smoothly.\nA quick way to do this is to open the Run dialog box by pressing Win+R, type sysdm.cpl, select Environment Variables under the Advanced tab of System Properties, choose Path in the System variables list, and add or edit the path of the R executable file.\n\n\n\n\nRun Dialog Box\n\nsysdm.cpl\n\n\n\n\nInstallation Verification\n\nTo verify a successful installation, run R and check the version. Since the path to the R executable file is registered in the environment variables, you can run R regardless of the folder where the run command is executed. To do this, open the Run dialog box by pressing Win+R, type cmd to open the Command Prompt, and type “R” to run R. Check if the R version displayed in the Command Prompt matches the installed version.\n\n\n\n\nRun Dialog Box\n\ncmd\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand Prompt\n\nR",

Python was designed with clear syntax and concise code writing in mind, allowing easy integration of various extension modules and libraries due to its extensibility. Thanks to these characteristics, Python has been widely adopted by the global developer community and has become a preferred language in various technical fields such as data science, web development, automation scripts, and machine learning [2].\nHere are some examples of Python’s applications in the medical field:\n\nMedical Image Analysis: Python is used for MRI, CT, and X-ray image analysis. Libraries such as PyDicom, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras are used for medical image analysis [[3]][4][5].\nGenomic Data Analysis: In bioinformatics, Python is used for gene sequence analysis and gene expression data processing. Biopython is an example of this application [6].\nClinical Research Data Management: Python supports the management and analysis of large-scale clinical research data.

YAML 헤더의 execute.freeze 옵션을 auto 또는 true로 설정하면 캐싱을 위해 _freeze 폴더가 생성됩니다.\n\n\n_manuscript 폴더\nQuarto manuscript 프로젝트에서는 기본적으로 렌더링 결과를 _manuscript 폴더에 만듭니다. 출력 결과를 다른 폴더로 변경하고자 할 때에는 YAML 헤더에서 output-dir: 원하는 폴더명으로 수정하시면 됩니다.\n\n\n_quarto.yml 파일\n_quarto.yml 파일은 Quarto 프로젝트의 설정을 관리하는 구성 파일입니다. 이 파일을 통해 프로젝트의 전반적인 설정, 문서 렌더링 옵션, 그리고 특정 문서의 형식과 출력을 제어할 수 있습니다.\n아래는 예제 R 프로젝트에 사용된 _quarto.yml 의 부분입니다.\n\n\n\nexample of _quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: manuscript\n\nmanuscript:\n  article: index.qmd\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    comments: \n      hypothesis: true \n#  docx: default \n#  jats: default\n\nexecute:\n  freeze: true\n\neditor: visual\n\n\nQuarto 프로젝트 설정은 문서 또는 기사 작성에 주로 사용되며, ‘manuscript’으로 유형이 지정되어 있습니다. 이 설정은 프로젝트의 메인 문서 파일로 ’index.qmd’를 지정하고 있습니다. ’index.qmd’ 파일은 Quarto Markdown 형식으로, 프로젝트의 핵심 내용을 포함하고 있습니다.\n문서의 출력 형식으로 HTML이 지정되어 있어, 생성된 문서가 웹 페이지 형태로 렌더링되어 표시될 것입니다. 이 HTML 출력 설정에는 댓글 기능이 포함되어 있으며, Hypothesis라는 오픈 소스 주석 도구가 활성화되어 있습니다. Hypothesis 도구를 통해 사용자는 웹 페이지에 직접 주석을 추가할 수 있습니다, 이는 인터랙티브한 문서 환경을 조성합니다.\n‘freeze: false’ 설정은 문서 빌드 시 실행 코드의 결과를 캐싱하지 않겠다는 것을 의미합니다. 즉, 이 설정은 문서가 빌드될 때마다 관련 코드가 매번 실행되어 결과가 갱신되도록 합니다.\n추가적으로, ‘docx’와 ’jats’ 형식은 현재 비활성화된 상태로 주석 처리되어 있습니다. 이는 렌더링 시간을 단축하기 위한 조치로, 비활성화된 상태에서는 이 포맷들이 문서 출력 형식으로 사용되지 않습니다.\n마지막으로, ‘editor: visual’ 설정은 Quarto 문서 작성 시 사용되는 에디터 유형을 명시합니다. Visual editor는 사용자가 마크다운 문법을 몰라도 문서를 작성할 수 있도록 지원하는 사용자 친화적인 인터페이스를 제공합니다. 이는 문서 작성 과정을 보다 직관적이고 접근하기 쉽게 만듭니다.\n이러한 설정들은 효과적인 문서 작성과 관리를 가능하게 하며, 사용자에게 다양한 도구와 옵션을 제공하여 유연한 작업 환경을 조성합니다.\n\n\n.gitignore 파일\n.gitignore 파일은 Git 버전 관리 시스템에서 특정 파일이나 디렉토리를 추적하지 않도록 설정하는 데 사용됩니다. 이 파일은 프로젝트 디렉토리 내에 위치하며, Git이 파일을 무시하도록 지시하는 패턴 목록을 포함하고 있습니다.\n\n\n.Rhistory 파일\n.Rhistory 파일은 R 프로그래밍 환경에서 사용자가 실행한 모든 명령어의 이력을 저장하는 파일입니다. 이 파일은 R 콘솔에서 직접 입력하거나 스크립트를 실행하는 동안의 사용자의 명령어들을 자동으로 기록합니다. 이 기능은 사용자가 이전 세션에서 수행한 작업을 추적하고, 필요한 경우 명령어를 재사용하거나 참조할 수 있게 해 줍니다.\n\n\n.Rprofile 파일\n.Rprofile 파일은 R 세션의 시작 시 자동으로 실행되는 스크립트를 포함하는 설정 파일입니다. 이 파일은 사용자 또는 특정 프로젝트에 대한 환경 설정을 사용자 정의하고, R 세션을 시작할 때마다 일관된 작업 환경을 구성하는 데 사용됩니다. .Rprofile은 R의 시작 시 자동으로 로드되므로, R을 사용하는 데 필요한 라이브러리 로딩, 옵션 설정, 환경 설정 등을 자동화할 수 있습니다. 예제 R프로젝트에서는 renv 환경이 활성화되도록 설정되어 있습니다.\n\n\nIndex.qmd 파일\nindex.qmd 파일은 Quarto 문서 프로젝트에서 중요한 역할을 하는 메인 문서 파일입니다. .qmd 확장자는 Quarto Markdown을 의미하며, 이 파일 형식은 Markdown의 확장 버전으로, Quarto에서 제공하는 다양한 기능을 지원합니다.\n\n\n*.Rproj 파일\n.Rproj 파일은 RStudio의 프로젝트 파일로, 특정 R 프로젝트와 관련된 설정과 환경을 저장합니다. 이 파일은 RStudio 환경에서 프로젝트를 더 효율적으로 관리할 수 있게 해 주며, 프로젝트별로 별도의 작업 공간과 설정을 유지할 수 있도록 도와줍니다.\n\n\nreferences.bib 파일\nreferences.bib 파일은 레퍼런스 관리와 문헌 인용을 위한 BibTeX 파일입니다. 이 파일은 주로 LaTeX 문서나 다양한 텍스트 편집 소프트웨어와 통합하여 사용되며, 학술적 작업, 연구 보고서, 논문 등에서 출처를 인용하고 관리하는 데 필요한 정보를 포함합니다.\n\n\nrenv 폴더\nrenv 폴더는 R 프로젝트에서 프로젝트별 종속성 관리를 위해 사용되는 renv 패키지에 의해 생성되는 디렉토리입니다. 이 폴더는 프로젝트의 라이브러리를 격리시켜 다른 프로젝트나 시스템의 R 패키지 설치와 독립적으로 유지할 수 있도록 도와줍니다. renv는 R의 프로젝트에 대한 복원 가능하고 재현 가능한 환경을 제공하는 데 중점을 두고 있습니다.\n\n\nrenv.lock 파일\nrenv.lock 파일은 R 프로젝트에서 renv 패키지를 사용할 때 생성되는 중요한 파일로, 프로젝트의 종속성(의존하는 R 패키지들)을 정확하고 재현 가능하게 기록합니다. 이 파일은 프로젝트에 필요한 모든 R 패키지의 버전과 소스 정보를 포함하여 프로젝트 환경을 재현할 수 있도록 돕습니다.",

    "text": "Statistical Applications\n\nAssumptions\nThe Chi-Square Test can be used when the expected frequency in each cell is greater than or equal to 5. If the expected frequency is low, the approximation of the Chi-Square Test may not be accurate.\n\n\nTest of Independence\nThe Chi-Square Test is widely used for testing independence. It is used to determine whether the relationship between two variables is independent or to ascertain if there is a statistically significant relationship.\n\n\nGoodness of Fit Test\nThe Chi-Square Test is also used for goodness of fit tests. This is used to determine if the observed data fits a theoretical distribution. For example, it can be used to check if the frequencies of each number when a die is rolled 60 times are uniform.",

    "text": "The Necessity of R and Python in Medical Data Research\nStatistical programs like SPSS or MedCalc are widely used in medical research. However, they are typically only available within hospital settings and cannot automate analysis processes.\nIn contrast, the open-source statistical language R allows automation of analysis processes through simple programming, excels in visualization, and seamlessly integrates with medical paper writing and web publication.\nPython, a general-purpose open-source programming language, is strong in machine learning and deep learning, and integrates well with R. Both languages also have the advantage of being capable of big data analysis.\nSome journals even accept submissions in R Markdown format to ensure reproducibility. Therefore, these open-source tools are advantageous for researchers, including those involved in clinical research.\n\n\nR Python Study Group\nThis site was created to assist in-house researchers who are interested in analyzing medical data using R and Python by RPythonStudy Group.\n\n\n\ne-mail\n\nr.python.study@gmail.com"

Platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide SSH key-based authentication, allowing you to securely connect to remote repositories using SSH keys instead of passwords. OpenSSH is open-source software that can be optionally installed during Git installation and is mainly used when setting up SSH-based authentication. OpenSSH is selected by default during the installation process, as shown in Figure 6, and it is recommended to use the default value unless there is a specific reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Options to select OpenSSH\n\n\n\n\n\nSSL/TLS Library Selection\nSSL/TLS is an encryption library used by Git when communicating with remote repositories over HTTPS. OpenSSL is recommended when broader encryption capabilities, support for the latest standards, and compatibility with Linux are important. The Windows-specific SSL/TLS library (Schannel) is recommended when you want integration with Windows systems and easy configuration. The research group recommends the default OpenSSL, as shown in Figure 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Options to select SSL/TLS library\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Ending Conversion Setting\nIn Windows, the default line ending setting is CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed). In contrast, Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS) use LF (Line Feed). When developing across operating systems, Git supports line ending conversion to resolve these line ending differences. You can set whether to automatically convert line endings during checkout and commit, with the default being Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings, which is suitable for development on Windows. If you are developing on Linux or macOS, it is recommended to select Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings, as shown in Figure 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Options to select Line Ending Conversion\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminal Emulator\nThis option determines the terminal environment to use in Git Bash. Each option defines the terminal to be used when Git Bash is run, and there are differences in user experience and terminal functionality. MinTTY provides a more advanced terminal experience and a working environment closer to Unix style. It is particularly suitable for users familiar with Linux/Unix or those who mainly use Git Bash. The Windows default console window is a terminal interface provided by Windows by default, suitable for users who prefer a familiar environment like CMD. It is especially suitable for Windows users or those who mainly use CMD, as shown in Figure 9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Options to select Terminal Emulator\n\n\n\n\n\ngit pull Setting\nThis setting determines how to merge changes between the local branch and the remote branch when the git pull command is executed, as shown in Figure 10.\n1. Fast-forward or merge (default setting) This option is set as the default and Git selects fast-forward merging or merge commit depending on the situation.\nFast-forward: If there are no additional changes in the local branch and you can simply append the commits from the remote branch, Git performs a fast-forward merge. In this case, no merge commit is created, and a new commit is added to the existing commit line.\nAdvantages: You can maintain a clean history, keeping a concise log without unnecessary merge commits.\nDisadvantages: There may be limitations in managing complex merge records during collaboration.\nMerge: If there are changes in the local branch or you cannot simply append the changes from the remote branch, a merge commit is created. This commit merges the histories of the two branches, clearly indicating the merge point.\nAdvantages: You can clearly distinguish the point where the merge occurred, making it easy to track who did what work.\nDisadvantages: The log can become complex as the number of merge commits increases.\n2. Rebase The Rebase option applies changes from the remote branch to the local branch without merge commits. Rebase rewrites the history by rearranging commits to make it look like you worked on the remote branch.\nRebase operation: Temporarily remove the commits made in the local branch, apply the changes from the remote branch first, and then reapply the local commits. This way, the history is straightened out, and the commit log becomes very clean.\nAdvantages: The history is concise and straightened out, making it easy to read the log. Since no merge commits are created, you can maintain a clean history even during collaboration.\nDisadvantages: Since Rebase rewrites the history, if you rebase a commit that has already been shared, conflicts may occur during collaboration or affect other developers’ commits. Rebase should be used carefully during collaboration, especially in branches where multiple developers are working simultaneously.\n3. Only ever fast-forward The Only ever fast-forward option sets a strong constraint to allow only fast-forward merges. If you select this option, Git performs a merge only when fast-forward is possible without creating a merge commit.\nOperation: If the local branch is ahead of the remote branch or a conflict occurs, it does not allow merging and raises an error. In other words, a fast-forward merge is possible only when the branch is behind the remote branch.\nAdvantages: You can keep the history absolutely clean. Since no merge commits are created, the history remains very concise. It is easy to manage the history, and it is suitable for those who prefer a clean, linear commit log.\nDisadvantages: Even if changes from other developers and local changes need to be merged during collaboration, only fast-forward is allowed, so Git may refuse to merge. In such cases, the merge may fail, and you may need to perform the merge manually. It can be restrictive in complex collaboration situations. Since merge commits may be necessary during collaboration, this option is somewhat limited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Options to select git pull\n\n\n\n\n\nGit Credential Manager\nGit Credential Manager is a tool that securely stores and automatically manages authentication information for remote repositories in Git. Through this, users can securely use Git without having to repeatedly enter credentials, and it is supported on various operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. It also supports modern authentication methods such as OAuth and token-based authentication, providing both security and convenience. Git Credential Manager can be optionally installed during Git installation, and it is recommended to use the default value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Options to select Git Credential Manager\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra Options\nFile System Caching is a feature that allows Git to more quickly query metadata (file status, permissions, timestamps, etc.) for the file system using a cache. By default, Git checks the status of files (e.g., modification time, size) to detect file changes in the file system. This process can cause performance degradation in large projects containing many files. Symbolic Links are a special type of file that points to a reference to a file or directory. Symbolic links store the path of the original file or directory and work by referencing it. When you enable the Symbolic Links option in Git, Git can store and manage the symbolic link itself instead of storing it as a file. Symbolic links are widely used and supported in Linux and macOS, so it is common to enable this option. Symbolic links are limited by default in Windows and require administrator privileges or specific settings to enable. Therefore, enabling this option in Windows may not work properly or may cause unexpected behavior. The default is to enable File System Caching, as shown in Figure 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Options to select Extra Options",

Wilcoxon의 접근법은 두 집단 간의 차이를 순위로 변환하여 순위 합을 비교하는 것이었으며, 이는 정규분포를 가정하지 않고도 두 독립된 표본 간의 차이를 평가할 수 있는 중요한 방법으로 자리 잡았습니다.\n\n\nMann과 Whitney의 확장\n1947년: 헨리 B. 만(Henry B. Mann)과 도로시 로빈스 와이트니(Dorothy Robbins Whitney)는 Wilcoxon의 순위합 검정을 확장하고 일반화했습니다. Mann과 Whitney는 두 독립된 표본의 순위를 비교하는 새로운 방법을 제안했으며, 이 방법은 Mann-Whitney U 검정으로 알려지게 되었습니다.\n이 검정법은 두 그룹 간의 차이를 평가하기 위해 U 통계량을 도입했습니다. U 통계량은 두 그룹의 순위를 비교하여 계산되며, 두 그룹이 동일한 분포를 따를 경우 U 통계량의 기대값이 계산됩니다. 귀무가설이 참일 때 이 U 통계량의 분포는 알려진 분포를 따르며, 이를 통해 p-값을 계산할 수 있습니다.\n\n\n비모수적 방법의 중요성\nMann-Whitney U 검정의 개발은 비모수적 방법의 중요성을 강조했습니다. 정규분포를 가정하지 않고도 데이터를 분석할 수 있는 방법을 제공했으며, 이는 특히 작은 표본이나 비정규 분포의 데이터를 다루는 데 매우 유용했습니다.\nMann-Whitney U 검정은 데이터의 실제 값이 아닌 순위를 사용하여 통계적 검정을 수행하므로, 이상값(outliers)이나 비대칭 분포의 영향을 덜 받습니다. 이 검정은 두 그룹 간의 차이를 비교할 때, 중앙값의 차이에 대한 강력한 비모수적 대안으로 널리 사용됩니다.\n\n\nMann-Whitney U 검정의 계산 과정:\n첫 번째 그룹에 대한 U 통계량:\n\\[\nU_1 = R_1 - \\frac{n_1 (n_1 + 1)}{2}\n\\]\n두 번째 그룹에 대한 U 통계량:\n\\[\nU_2 = R_2 - \\frac{n_2 (n_2 + 1)}{2}\n\\]\n여기서:\n\n\\(R_1\\)과 \\(R_2\\)는 각각 첫 번째와 두 번째 그룹의 순위 합,\n\\(n_1\\)과 \\(n_2\\)는 각각 첫 번째와 두 번째 그룹의 표본 크기입니다.\n\n최종적으로 두 값 중 작은 U 통계량이 선택되며, 이 값에 따라 두 그룹 간의 차이가 유의미한지를 판단합니다.\n\n# 필요한 패키지 로드\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# 정규분포를 따르지 않는 두 그룹 데이터 생성\nset.seed(123)\ngroup1 &lt;- rexp(30, rate = 0.2)  # 지수분포\ngroup2 &lt;- rexp(30, rate = 0.3) + 2  # 다른 지수분포 + 상수로 이동\n\n# t-검정 수행\nt_test_result &lt;- t.test(group1, group2)\nt_test_p_value &lt;- t_test_result$p.value\n\n# Mann-Whitney U 검정 수행\nu_test_result &lt;- wilcox.test(group1, group2)\nu_test_p_value &lt;- u_test_result$p.value\n\n# 결과 출력\ncat(\"t-검정 p-값:\", t_test_p_value, \"\\n\")\n\nt-검정 p-값: 0.1227817 \n\ncat(\"Mann-Whitney U 검정 p-값:\", u_test_p_value, \"\\n\")\n\nMann-Whitney U 검정 p-값: 0.03576713 \n\n# 두 그룹의 분포를 히스토그램으로 시각화\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  value = c(group1, group2),\n  group = factor(c(rep(\"Group 1\", 30), rep(\"Group 2\", 30)))\n)\n\np &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = value, fill = group)) +\n  geom_histogram(position = \"identity\", alpha = 0.6, bins = 15) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Comparison of Two Non-Normal Distributions\",\n       x = \"Value\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n\n# 그래프 출력\nprint(p)",

    "text": "History of R Development\nR was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and was first released in 1993. The language was conceived as an open-source alternative to the S programming language, which was developed by John Chambers and others at Bell Laboratories. The design philosophy of R was centered around providing a user-friendly environment for data analysis, with an emphasis on extensibility and ease of use (Ihaka & Gentleman, 1996).\nOver the years, R has undergone significant enhancements, with contributions from a global community of developers and researchers. The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) was established to host R packages, which are collections of functions and data sets developed by the community. As of 2024, there are over 18,000 packages available on CRAN, covering a wide range of statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and specialized tools for various disciplines, including biostatistics and epidemiology (CRAN, 2024).\n\n\nR & Medical Research\nThe adoption of R in medical research has been driven by its flexibility, robust statistical capabilities, and the availability of specialized packages. For instance, the survival package, developed by Terry Therneau, provides a comprehensive suite of tools for survival analysis, a critical method in clinical trials and epidemiological studies (Therneau, 2000). Additionally, the caret package simplifies the process of building and evaluating predictive models, which are increasingly used in precision medicine to tailor treatments to individual patients (Kuhn, 2008).\nOne of the key factors contributing to R’s importance in medical research is its ability to handle large, complex datasets. As medical records become increasingly digitized, researchers face the challenge of analyzing vast amounts of heterogeneous data. R’s data manipulation and visualization capabilities, particularly through packages like dplyr and ggplot2, allow researchers to explore and interpret data effectively, uncovering insights that might be missed with traditional methods (Wickham, 2016).\nGenomic Research: R has played a pivotal role in the analysis of genomic data, which is crucial for understanding the genetic basis of diseases and developing targeted therapies. The Bioconductor project, an open-source software project built on R, provides tools for the analysis of high-throughput genomic data. This has enabled researchers to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and identify genetic variants associated with diseases such as cancer and diabetes (Huber et al., 2015).\nClinical Trials: In clinical trials, accurate and reproducible statistical analysis is essential for assessing the efficacy and safety of new treatments. R’s robust statistical packages, combined with its reproducibility features, make it an ideal choice for clinical trial analysis. For example, the rms package facilitates regression modeling strategies, helping researchers to develop and validate predictive models in clinical studies (Harrell, 2015).\nThe increasing complexity of medical research, coupled with the rise of big data, has underscored the importance of R as a tool for medical researchers. The ability to integrate data from diverse sources, perform complex statistical analyses, and generate reproducible research has made R indispensable in modern medical research. Moreover, the open-source nature of R ensures that researchers can collaborate and share their methods, leading to more robust and transparent scientific practices.\nAs the field of medical research continues to evolve, the importance of R is likely to grow. Emerging areas such as precision medicine, where treatments are tailored to individual patients based on their genetic profiles, rely heavily on the advanced analytical capabilities provided by R. Additionally, the integration of machine learning methods into clinical research, facilitated by R, is expected to lead to new insights and innovations in patient care.\n\n\nReferences\n\nIhaka, R., & Gentleman, R.

Attribute들은 모든 element들이 이름지어진 곳에 pairlist처럼 저장되지만, name=value pair들의 세트처럼 생각되어야만 합니다. attribute들의 목록은 attributes를 사용하여 얻을 수 있고 attributes&lt;-에 의해 설정됩니다. 각각의 구성요소들은 attr와 attr&lt;-를 사용하여 접근됩니다.\n몇몇의 attribute들은 (예를들어 factor들을 위한 levels&lt;-) 특별한 accessor function들을 가지고있고 이들은 사용가능할 때만 사용되어야만 합니다. 실행의 숨겨진 디테일에 추가적으로, 그들은 추가적인operation들을 실행할 지도 모릅니다. R은 특별한 attribute을 포함하고 일관적인 확인들을 강요하는 attr&lt;-와 attributes&lt;-로의 call들을 가로채려고 시도합니다.\n행렬들과 열들은 간단하게말해서 dim attribute를 가진 벡터들이고 옵션적으로 dimnames가 벡터에 부여되어있습니다.\nAttribute들은 R에 사용된 class structure을 이행하하기위해 사용되었습니다. 만약 object가 class attribute를 가지고 있다면 그 attribute는 평가 도중 검토될 것입니다. R의 class structure은 Object-oriented programming에 자세하게 설명되어있습니다.\n\nNames\nNames 속성은, 존재할 때, 벡터나 목록의 각각의 요소들에 label을 합니다. Object가 존재하는 names의 속성을 프린트하려고 할 때, 요소들을 label하기위하여 쓰여집니다. Names 속성은 예를들어quantile(x)[“25%”]와 같은 indexing 목적으로도 쓰여질 수 있습니다.\nnames와 names&lt;- 구성들을 사용하여 name들을 얻거나 설정할 수도 있습니다. 뒷쪽 것 (names&lt;-)은 names 속성이 적합한 타입과 길이를 가지고있는지를 확실히 하기 위해 필요한 일관적인 체크를 수행할 것입니다.\nPairlist들과 일차원 행들은 특별하게 대해집니다. Pairlist object들에는, 가상의 names 속성이 사용되어집니다; names 속성은 사실상 목록 구성요소들의 태그에서부터 구성됩니다. 일차원 행들에서 names 속성은 실제로dimnames[[1]]에 접근합니다.\n\n\nDimensions\ndim 속성은 행들을 이행하기위하여 쓰여집니다. 행의 내용은 열방향순서의 벡터안에 저장되고, 그 dim 속성은 각각의 행의 규모를 명시하는 정수의 벡터입니다. R은 벡터의 길이가dimension 길이의 산출물임을 확실하게 합니다. 하나 이상의 dimension의 길이가 0일 수도 있습니다.\n벡터는 dim 속성이 없는 반면, 일차원 행은 길이가 1인 dim 속성을 가지고 있기때문에, 일차원 행과 같지 않습니다.\n\n\nDimnames\n행은 문자 벡터의 목록인 dimnames 속성을 사용하여 각각의 dimension을 따로 이름지을 수도 있습니다. dimnames 목록이 자기 자신의 이름을 가지고 있을 수 있으며, 그러면 이는 행들을 프린트 할 때 extent heading들로 쓰여집니다.\n\n\nClasses\nR은class 속성을 통해 주로 컨트롤되는 정교한 class 시스테을 가지고 있습니다. 이 속성은object가 inherit하는 곳의 class들의 목록을 포함하고있는 문자 벡터입니다. 이 형태들은 R의 “일반적인 방법을” 기능의 기초를 형성합니다.\n이 속성은 사용자에의한 제한 없이도 가상적으로 접근되고 조작될 수 있습니다. 여기에는 object가 class 방법들이 예상하는 구성요소들을 확실히 포함하고 있는지를 확인하는 것이 없습니다. 그러므로 class 속성을 대신하는 것은 조심해서 해야만하며, 이들이 사용 가능할 때는 구체적인 창출과 강제 function들이 선호되어야만합니다.\n\n\nTime series attributes\ntsp 속성은 시계열 분석, 시작, 끝, 그리고 빈도의 매개변수를 붙잡고 있기위해 사용됩니다. 이 구성은 월간 혹은 분기별 데이터처럼 주기적인 하부구조를 가진 series들을 다루기위해 주로 사용됩니다.",

    "text": "인터넷검색 시 정리가 잘 된 부분을 발췌하였습니다.\n지루한 일상의 소중함 중에서 ……. https://every-day-life.tistory.com/30\n\n1. Kaplan-Meier curve\n상당수의 의학논문에서 생존분석을 이용해서 분석을 하는 경우, Kaplan-Meier curve를 제시하고 그 후 cox 분석을 주요분석법으로 사용한다. Kaplan curve를 보여주는 이유는 아무래도 단조로운 논문에 그래도 그림이 하나쯤은 필요하기 때문이기도 하지만 더 큰 이유는 cox 분석을 사용하기 위한 주요 가정 중 하나인 proportional hazard assumption을 만족하는지를 Kaplan curve가 rough하게 보여주기 때문이다.\n마지막으로 proportional hazard에 대한 언급을 해 보자. cox 분석은 여러 분석법 중 신경 쓸 일 많지 않은 쉬운 분석법 중에 하나이다. 하지만 비례위험 가정은 꼭!!! 어기면 안 된다.  비례위험 가정에 대해 예를 들어보면, 암환자의 경우 진단 후 초/중반에는 사망위험이 높지만 시간이 지날수록 사망 위험도는 점차 감소하다,  5년 이상 생존하는 경우 사망위험이 일반인보다 약간 높을 정도까지 낮아진다. 만약 새로운 항암제의 효과에 대해 연구하고 싶다면 신/구 항암제의 위험도 차이가 초반에나 후반에나 동일해야 한다는 것이다. \n\n왼쪽 그림과 같이 시간에 상관없이 위험도는 동일한 간격을 가져야 한다. 만약 오른쪽 그림과 같이 위험도가 일정한 간격을 지니지 않을 경우 시간에 대해 별도의 배려를 해야만 한다.  \n비례위험가정을 확인하는 법은 몇 가지 방법이 있지만 SPSS에서 가능한 방법은 누적위험함수 그래프를 확인하는 법과 Cox 분석 내에서의 time dependent covariate를 압력하는 방법 2가지 이다. 결과가 통계적으로 유의하더라도 Kaplan curve 및 위험함수 그래프에서 두 선이 접점을 가지게 되면 비례위험가정을 만족하지 못하는 것으로 생각하는 편이 맞다(정확히는 Scheonfeld residual을 구해서 확인해야 하는데 SPSS에서는 이 과정이 불가능하다.). 그리고 논문 첫 figure로 Kaplan curve를 넣는 이유 중 하나가 비례위험가정만족을 보여주는 그림이기 때문이다. 만약 Kaplan curve에서 두 선의 교차가 발생했는데도 불구하고 시간에 대한 별도의 배려 없이 논문이 진행되었다면 독자들은 그 이후 결과를 전체적으로 신뢰할 수 없게 될 것이다.  (상대적으로 Kaplan curve에서는 비례위험가정을 만족하더라도 대상자의 수가 적어지는 후반부에 교차(접점?)가 일어날 가능성이 있다. 다른 방법으로 비례위험가정을 확인했고 문제가 없다면 누적위험함수 그래프를 대신 제시하는 것도 하나의 방법이다.)\n\n\n2. Cox\nCox 분석의 정식 명칭은 proportional hazards model regression analysis이다. 정식 명칭을 보면 앞에서 왜 그토록  proportional hazard assumption을 강조했는지와, Cox 분석도 일반화선형회귀분석의 한 분류라는 것을 알 수 있다. 전체적인 분위기는 로지스틱회귀분석과 놀라울 정도로 닮아 있다. 잔차분석이 그리 중요하지 않다던가… 연속형 변수 사용에 유의해야 한다던가… \n시간의 분포를 보면 연구의 대략적인 결과를 파악할 수 있다. 생존분석에서 시간은 사망하거나(event), 연구에서 중도탈락(censoring)한 두 가지 경우 중 하나이다. 시간의 histogram을 보면 전체적으로 right shifted 된 느낌인 가운데 0과 200근처가 우뚝 서있는 것을 볼 수 있다. 0에 가까운 봉우리는 아마도 작심삼일 들일 것이며, 200에 가까운 봉우리는 연구 종료에 따른 censoring일 것이다. 위 그림을 보면 연구 종료를 제외하면 censoring이 없음을 알 수 있다. 이는 이 연구가 굉장히 잘 관리된 연구 결과임을 보여준다.\n \n대부분의 연구에서 무시되고 있는 내용인데, 생존분석에서 중도탈락은 무작위(random)하게 이루어지는 것으로 가정된다. 하지만 실제 연구에서는 중도탈락이 의미를 지니는 경우가 많다. 치료약의 부작용이 심하거나, 환자가 스스로 판단하기에 호전이 없을 경우, 무작위 배정 결과가 중간에 환자에게 노출되어 위약군 환자가 연구에서 빠져나가는 경우… 어찌 보면 중도탈락은 사망결과만큼이나 중요한 결과이지만 일반적인 cox분석 결과에서는 중도탈락을 결과물로 제시하지 않는다. 하지만 연구 결과를 판단할 때 신약의 치료효과가 아무리 좋더라도 이해할 수 없는 이유로 치료군 혹은 placebo군의 중도탈락이 반대편에 비해 의미가 있을 정도로 많다면 그 결과는 신뢰하지 않는 것이 바람직하다.\n로지스틱회귀분석에서와 같이 생존분석에서도 연속변수를 분석하는 데에는 주의가 따른다. 따라서 적절한 값을 기준으로 잘라서 범주형 변수로 분석하는 것이 합리적이다. 하지만 대상자의 수가 많지 않아서 범주형 변수로 잘랐을 때 통계적으로 유의해지지 않는다던가, 범주형 변수로 변환하더라도 어느 값을 기준으로 몇 개의 범주로 나누는 것이 합리적인지 판단할 때에는 연속형 변수를 이용한 분석이 도움이 될 때도 있다. 이때 사용되는 것이 Martingale 잔차이지만 SPSS에서는 이를 지원하지 않기 때문에, SPSS를 이용해서 생존분석을 하는 경우 연속형 변수를 분석에 투입하면 안 된다.\n변수를 범주화시킬 때 주의사항은 임상적인 의미를 가지는 절단점이 있는 경우 그 점을 우선시하되, 나눈 후 각 범주에 속한 대상자들이 어느 정도 균등해지는 것도 고려해야 한다. 만약 systolic BP를 기준으로 한다고 했을 때 가장 최적의 절단점은 140일 것이다. 하지만 어떤 이유로 140mmHg 이상 혹은 이하의 대상자가 아주 많거나 적으면 그 변수를 분석에 투입한다고 해도 의미를 잃을 것이다. 그렇다고 systoloc BP를 quantile 값으로 나눠서 넣으면 분석은 잘되겠지만, 논문의 심사자 혹은 독자들은 왜 이걸 이리 잘랐지?라는 의문을 가질 수밖에 없다. 따라서 케이스 바이 케이스의 적절한 판단이 요구될 수 밖에 없다.\nproportional hazard 가정을 확인하는 방법으로는\n1) Kaplan curve 이용한 육안적 확인\n2) Schenofeld residual 그래프 이용한 육안적 확인\n3) Scheonfeld method 이용한 통계적 확인\n4) time dependent covariate 투입 후 통계적 유의성 확인 \n4가지 방법이 있다. SPSS에서는 2와 3번 방법은 불가능하다. 하지만 생존분석에서 비례위험가정의 중요성을 감안하면 다른 방법이 존재하며 이 부분은 SPSS의 한계가 있음을 알아야 한다.\n\n\n폐암환자의 성별에 따른 Kaplan curve와 위험함수 그래프이다. 앞에서 언급했듯이 논문에 Kaplan curve를 넣는 이유는 비례위험가정을 만족하는지 확인하기 위함이라고 하였다. Cox 분석에서 통계적으로 유의성을 가지는 변수가 (유의성 없는 변수는 접점이 몇 개 있던 몇 번 교차하던 상관없다.) Kaplan curve에서 접점을 지니거나 교차하면 비례위험 가정에서 벗어나 있을 가능성을 고려해야 한다. \n다만 실제 논문에는 위의 예제와 같이 성별에 따른 Kaplan curve보다는 논문의 주 목표인 치료법에 의한 Kaplan curve를 주로 넣게 될 것 같다. 문제는 시간이 어느 정도 흘러서 양쪽 그룹에 대상자가 줄어들게 되면 Kaplna curve에서는 비례위험 가정을 만족하는 상태에서도 접점 비슷한 모양이 보일 수 있다는 점이다. 당장 위의 예제만 봐도 시간 800근처에서 접점이 생길 뻔했다. \n비례위험가정의 확인은 어디까지나 위험함수를 가지고 하는 것이다. 편의 상 Kaplan curve를 논문에 넣기는 하지만 위의 예와 같이 누적위험함수에서는 별 문제없어 보이지만 Kaplan curve에서는 접점 비슷한 것이 보이는 경우, Kaplan curve를 그림으로 넣은 상황에서는 논문 내에 비례위험 가정이 어쩌고저쩌고 말로 변명해봐야 소용없는 경우가 있을 수 있다. 따라서 이런 경우 약간 덜 일반적일지라도 차라리 위험함수곡선을 제시하거나 아니면 SPSS말고 다른 통계 패키지를 이용해서 Schenfeld 잔차를 구해 이를 제시하고 그림은 Cox curve를 제시하는 것도 하나의 방법이다. \n하여간 Kaplan curve건 위험 함수 그래프이건 접점을 가지는 것은 비례위험가정을 만족하지 않는다는 것을 보여주는 상황이며 이에 대해서는 적절한 대응이 필요하다.\n\n\n분석팁\nEMR로부터 다운로드하거나 연구가가 작성한 자료는 주로 엑셀파일형태이다. 이를 R로 읽어오면 엑셀에서 각 컬럼별로 자료형태를 지정해 두었더라도 달라질 수 있어 적절한 숫자형(연속형변수)이나 문자형(범주형변수)으로 수정해야 한다.\n연속형변수의 생존분석을 위해서는 2분화가 일반적인데 cut-off를 결정하기 위해 ROC 분석보다는 maxstat 패키지의 maxstat.test()를 이용한다. (https://rpubs.com/cardiomoon/84975)\n비례위험가정과 log-rank test에서의 유의성 확인을 위해 Kaplan-Meier plot를 그린다. ’survminer’패키지의 ’ggsurvplot’함수\n이때 재발여부 등의 값은 단순히 numeric으로 0과 1로만 지정해야 할 수 있다. factor로 지정하면 Right censoered data only 오류가 발생할 수 있다.\nCox 단변량 다변량분석을 한다.\n웹에서 하는 R통계(web-r.org)에서는 이와 같은 방법으로 생존분석을 자동화하여 연속형변수는 cutpoint를 구해 자동으로 그래프를 그려준다. 또한 여러개의 변수를 영향변수(독립변수)로 넣어주면 각각의 변수에 대한 Cox비례위험 모형 및 각각의 survival curve를 그려주고 다변량 분석 및 stepwise backward elemination 까지 한번 입력으로 얻을 수 있으며 그 결과를 html또는 pdf로 다운받을 수 있고 그래프도 고해상도로 다운 받을 수 있다.\n다변량분석에서 결측치의 처리는 아래의 기준을 따른다.\n5% 이하의 결측치 비율: (이 내용는 chatGPT의 추천이므로 추후 검증이 필요함.)\n참고문헌: Little, R.J.A. & Rubin, D.B. (2002). Statistical Analysis with Missing Data (2nd Edition). Wiley-Interscience. ISBN: 978-0471183860. 근거: Little과 Rubin의 연구에서는 결측치가 5% 이하일 때, 무작위 결측(MCAR, Missing Completely at Random)으로 간주될 수 있으며, 이는 분석 결과에 큰 영향을 미치지 않는다는 점을 강조합니다. 따라서 결측치가 5% 이하인 경우, 데이터를 분석에 포함시키고 단순히 대체하거나 무시할 수 있습니다.\n5% ~ 20%의 결측치 비율: (이 내용는 chatGPT의 추천이므로 추후 검증이 필요함.)\n참고문헌: Schafer, J.L. (1997). Analysis of Incomplete Multivariate Data. CRC Press. ISBN: 978-0412040610. 근거: Schafer의 연구에서는 결측치가 5%에서 20% 사이일 경우, 결측치의 패턴과 원인을 분석하고 적절한 대체 방법을 사용하는 것이 중요하다고 언급합니다. 이 범위 내의 결측치는 분석 방법에 따라 처리 방법을 다르게 적용할 수 있으며, 결측치 대체 방법의 선택이 분석 결과에 중요한 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다.\n결측치를 대체는 일반적으로 간편하게는 평균값으로 대체하는 것과 다소 복잡하게는 회귀모델을 이용하는 방법이 있다. 자세한 방법은 R 코딩 예시를 참고한다.\n암환자 생존분석자료의 검증 분석대상자들의 나이에 대한 검증 해당암의 우리나라 연령대별 발생율과 비교하는 것을 고려해 보았다. 5세구간으로 남녀가 비교가 가능하다. 대장암자료로 생존분석한 예시 코드 참고를 바란다.",
